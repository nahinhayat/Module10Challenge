Module 10 Challenge

In this program I used unsupervised machine learning to find clusters in market data of different crypto currencies by running the KMeans algorithm. I also used Principal Component Data to optimize the data and find clusters using the PCA data.

Details:

First the data for the cryptos was imported

Then the data was normalized using the StandardScaler Module

The best value for K was then found using the elbow method

Next the cryptos were clustered using the original data

Using PCA data, three new components were created from the original data

After this the process of finding clusters with the original data was done again using the PCA components and these visualizations were composited to compare.
